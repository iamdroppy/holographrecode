Holograph Emulator (C#.NET, codename Eucalypt) was originally coded by Nillus. The source featured a C#.NET console application that utilized the Habbo Hotel v21 gamefiles. The source is still used and developed to this day but I consider it to be a dead-end as there are simply too many bugs.

In a bid to revive Holograph Emulator and to halt people from using the old version, I am re-coding the whole of the Emulator using Nillus' base, ION.

Holograph Emulator (C#.NET, codename Orlando) is the new version of Holograph on the block. For the moment, the Emulator is being re-coded to use Habbo's v26 gamedata. There are currently no plans to cater for any version other than v26.

I urge you to visit the RaGEZONE thread for more information and progress on this task. Kind regards, TomSpit.
